This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue in Groovy related to null handling in arithmetic operations.  Groovy implicitly treats null values as 0 in arithmetic expressions, which can lead to subtle and hard-to-debug errors if not handled carefully. The example showcases this behavior and provides a solution for robust null handling.

## Problem

Groovy's default behavior of converting null values to 0 during arithmetic operations can lead to unexpected results, especially when dealing with user inputs or external data sources where null values might be common.  The provided `calculate` function initially does not explicitly check for null values. This can make the result of calculation difficult to determine when dealing with null inputs.

## Solution

To mitigate this issue, explicitly check for null values before performing any arithmetic operations.  The improved `calculate` function in `bugSolution.groovy` demonstrates how to correctly handle nulls, ensuring a more predictable and reliable outcome.
